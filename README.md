## Build and run

`gradlew bootRun` and open [http://localhost:8080](localhost:8080) in browser

## To do
1. Add more tests on various levels. For now they are skipped due to low amount of branches in code.
2. Restrict available cities by server and keep list in one place
    * for now list is kept in front-end which is incorrect and not safe
3. It must be decided whether date shown is date of the user, server or date in the city right now
